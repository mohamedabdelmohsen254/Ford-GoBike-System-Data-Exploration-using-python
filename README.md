•	The Goal of this presentation is to explore the main features of bike-sharing in the greater San Francisco Bay area. The main goal here is to specify the main determinants of trip duration by looking at the relationship between trip duration and other explanatory variables in the dataset. We try to answer the following questions:
1.	What does the distribution of trip duration look like?
2.	Which days have the highest demand on trips?
3.	Which hours during the day have the highest demand on trips?
4.	How trip duration differs by user age, hour, day, and user type?
